# DataExplorer
StructuredDataExplorer is a class created to do semi-automated analysis and visualisation of tabular data. This is achieved through simple high level function calls to get basic plots and statistics of the different fields in the data. Specifically the functionalities are written to perform the initial exploratory analysis of tabular data in an automated fashion, particularly prior to performing any predictive modelling (classification / regression) in the dataset for machine learning problems.
This is a work in progress and requires documentation update for the individual functions.
